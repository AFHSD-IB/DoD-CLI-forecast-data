## DoD CLI surveillance data

This page provides teams with information on the surveillance data provided to participating teams.


## Data use

All participants must sign a [Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)](https://github.com/cdcepi/DOD-CLI-forecast-data/blob/master/data-surveillance/Disease_Forecasting_Challenge_MOA_23AUG2022.docx) to receive the aggregated data elements weekly during the forecasting period. Questions and correspondence, including submitting the MOA, should be sent to <dha.ncr.health-surv.mbx.dodflucontest@health.mil>. Once the MOA is in place, AFHSD-IB will notify participants by email to download the DoD data from GitHub. Once the MOA is signed and executed, historical ESSENCE surveillance data may be used for training and model development. Teams are welcome and encouraged to utilize additional data beyond the provided ESSENCE data.


## Reported target data
Data consist of weekly aggregate counts of CLI medical encounters for the 15 largest MHS markets based on DoD service member and beneficiary data. CLI forecasts should be based on the ESSENCE CLI definition as specified in Table A.1 of the [guidelines](https://github.com/cdcepi/DoD-CLI-forecast-data/blob/main/collaboration-guidelines.docx). The short-term targets are the percent of outpatient, MTF encounters experiencing CLI one week, two weeks, three weeks, and four weeks ahead from the week of most recently provided data.
