Evaluation
------------------

Scores will be generated each week during the forecasting period to assess the utility of each model by comparing the observed weekly CLI values to the forecasted values for each MHS market. The final observed weekly CLI values for internal forecast evaluation will be determined by the reported ESSENCE data as of 6 weeks after the last forecasting target (after EW30) and used to determine final scores for the forecasting challenge. 

Only forecasts for models designated as "primary" will be scored. See team_model_designation description in the data [formatting instructions](./data-forecasts/README.md#Data-formatting) for details.
